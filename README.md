# VocabAI: The AI-Powered Vocabulary Builder

VocabAI is a sleek, modern web application designed to help users learn English vocabulary in a dynamic and contextual way. Instead of static definitions, VocabAI leverages the Google Gemini AI to provide rich, in-depth explanations for words, including custom definitions, example sentences, and grammatical analysis.

This project is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React (Vite), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for a beautiful, responsive, and fast user experience.
